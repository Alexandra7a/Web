# 🎯 Purpose
  Make Ajax requests for backend resources and use them in frontend. I used XAMPP to enable the Apache server and MySQL database.
  ## Trains departures and arrivals
   The entire process is based on Ajax calls.
  * Two combo boxes for trips
  * One for departure, loaded at the beginning
  * The other one is filled with the arrival destinations for the departure selected<br><br>

## Paging for a list of people
* The data is requested from the DB and brought to frontend
* The people's data is displayed as a paragraph
* The 'next', 'previous' buttons navigate through the batches of data, keeping track of  the first and last page and making the specific button disabled<br><br>

## Tic Tac Toe
* A matrix 3x3 to make a game between the player and the computer
* The player makes a move and then the computer choose one, transferring the board through Ajax requests
* The checks for the winer is done on the backend<br><br>
