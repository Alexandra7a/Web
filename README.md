# 🎯 Purpose
  Make Ajax requests for backend resources and use them in frontend. I used XAMPP to enable the Apache server and MySQL database.
  ## Trains departures and arrivals
   The entire process is based on Ajax calls.
  * Two combo boxes for trips
  * one for departure, loaded at the begining
  * the other one is filled with the arrival destinations for the departure selected<br><br>

## Paging for a list of people
* the data is requested from the DB and brought to frontend
* the people's data is displayed as a paragraph
* 'next', 'previus' buttons navigate through the batches of data, keeping track of  the first and last page and making the specific button disabled
